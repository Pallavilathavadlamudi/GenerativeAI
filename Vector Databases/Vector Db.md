### What is a Vector Database?

A **vector database** is a special kind of database that stores and searches data in the form of **vectors** (also called embeddings). These vectors are just long lists of numbers that represent the meaning or features of things like text, images, or audio.

Instead of using exact keywords, a vector database can **understand similarity** between items â€” like finding documents that mean the same thing, even if they use different words.

Key features include:

* Stores both the **vector** and related **metadata** (like titles, tags, etc.)
* Can **filter and scale** to handle millions of items
* Supports **real-time updates** and is built with **security** in mind

These databases make it easy to do smart searches across large datasets, especially when using AI models that turn raw data into these vector representations.
