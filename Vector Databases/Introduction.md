## **Introduction to Vector Databases and Embeddings**

In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow, one of the most important components is the **vector database**—a specialized storage system designed to handle vector representations of data.

Unlike traditional databases that store text, numbers, or binary files directly, vector databases store **vectors**—numerical representations of data. These vectors capture the meaning, structure, or properties of the original data (such as text, images, or audio) in a mathematical form, enabling **fast similarity search**.

To create these vectors, we use a process called **embedding**. An embedding model takes raw input—like a document, image, or audio file—and converts it into a fixed-length numerical array. Each dimension of this vector represents a specific learned feature of the data. This allows the system to compare and retrieve similar items efficiently.

For example:

* An image of a banana is converted into a vector based on its visual features.
* Another banana image will have a similar vector, enabling quick matching through **similarity search** rather than pixel-by-pixel comparison.
* In text search, embeddings enable **semantic search**, where a query like *“love”* can also find results containing related words like *“affection”* or *“romance”*.

Vector databases—such as **Pinecone** or open-source alternatives like **FAISS**—are optimized for storing and retrieving these embeddings quickly, even across millions of records. This makes them ideal for applications in AI, including document search, image retrieval, recommendation systems, and chatbot memory.
