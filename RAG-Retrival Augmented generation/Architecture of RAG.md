## **Architecture of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**

At a high level, the RAG architecture involves a **user query**, a **framework (like LangChain)**, a **vector database**, and a **language model (LLM)**. Let's go step by step:

### 🔁 **Step-by-Step Workflow**

| **Step** | **Component**                    | **What Happens**                                                                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣      | **User**                         | The user submits a question like “How does your API work?”                                                                |
| 2️⃣      | **Framework (e.g., LangChain)**  | The question is passed to a framework that manages the full workflow. It handles coordination, routing, and logic.        |
| 3️⃣      | **Semantic Search in Vector DB** | The framework performs **semantic search** in a **vector database** to retrieve relevant chunks of information/documents. |
| 4️⃣      | **Fetch Relevant Data**          | The vector DB returns the **most relevant content** based on similarity to the user's question.                           |
| 5️⃣      | **Construct a Prompt**           | The framework builds a prompt that includes: <br> • The original user question <br> • Retrieved relevant context          |
| 6️⃣      | **Send Prompt to LLM**           | The constructed prompt is passed to a **language model (LLM)** like OpenAI GPT or a local LLM.                            |
| 7️⃣      | **LLM Generates Response**       | The LLM uses both the user question and retrieved context to generate a **factually grounded** response.                  |
| 8️⃣      | **Post-processing (optional)**   | The framework may clean, format, or cache the response.                                                                   |
| 9️⃣      | **User Gets Answer**             | The user receives a well-informed, contextual, and accurate answer.                                                       |


### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

* RAG enhances LLMs by adding **real-time context**.
* **Vector search** is the heart of RAG—it brings in the relevant info.
* **LangChain** or similar frameworks coordinate the flow.
* The **LLM doesn’t "know" everything—it relies on retrieved context** to generate grounded, accurate answers.
* This architecture is modular—you can scale it with caching, user personalization, database integration, etc.
