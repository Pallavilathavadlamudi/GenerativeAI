## **Large Language Models (LLMs): An Overview**

### What Are LLMs?

* **Definition**:
  Large Language Models are AI models trained to understand, interpret, and generate human-like text.

* **Core Functionality**:
  They use **transformers** to process and predict text based on vast corpora of data.

### **Capabilities of LLMs**

| Capability             | Description                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text Generation**    | Produce coherent, contextually relevant responses                               |
| **Text Understanding** | Summarize, interpret, and analyze long text inputs                              |
| **Translation**        | Translate text between languages without needing specialized translation models |

### **How LLMs Work (Simplified Flow)**

1. **Input** (Human Language)
2. **Encoding** into machine-readable tokens
3. **Processing** through transformer layers and attention mechanisms
4. **Prediction** of the next word or token
5. **Decoding** into readable text (output)

## **Training Techniques**

| Type                       | Description                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Supervised Learning**    | Labeled input-output pairs provided (e.g., text → sentiment)           |
| **Unsupervised Learning**  | No labels; the model learns from patterns in raw data                  |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Human feedback (thumbs up/down) is used to adjust and improve behavior |

> Example: ChatGPT’s RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)

## **Evolution of GPT (OpenAI)**

| Model                | Year | Parameters     | Key Features & Impact                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GPT (1)**          | 2018 | 117M           | Introduced transformer-based LLMs                                     |
| **GPT-2**            | 2019 | 1.5B           | Scaled up; withheld initially due to "misuse" concerns                |
| **GPT-3**            | 2020 | 175B           | Enabled **few-shot learning**; major boost in general-purpose NLP     |
| **GPT-3.5**          | 2022 | \~100B (est.)  | Turbo version used in early ChatGPT; popular with developers          |
| **GPT-4**            | 2023 | \~1T (rumored) | Introduced **multimodal capabilities** (text + image)                 |
| **GPT-4o & 4o-mini** | 2024 | ~              | Advanced "reasoning" capabilities, audio input/output, fast & compact |

## **Notable Advancements in GPT-4 & Beyond**

* **Multimodal Input**: Text + images (can process both)
* **Reasoning Models**: GPT-4o behaves like a human — capable of real-time reasoning
* **Safety Concerns**:

  * Voice cloning controversies
  * Deepfakes and impersonation risks
* **4o-mini**: Compact, affordable, and the most widely used successor to GPT-3.5 Turbo
